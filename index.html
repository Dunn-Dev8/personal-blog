    <p>Body of the Document</p>
    <p>To start blogging run the postmkr.py and edit it with the details you want for your blog post, and WM.py will manage the rest for you.</p>
    
    <p>If you would like to make your own page then WM.py does have a function to do that in the main postmkr.py but it is recomended that you make the page yourself for more control over your website.</p>
